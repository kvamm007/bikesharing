# Citibike Trip Analysis
## Overview
We performed this analysis to identify trends of Citibike users in New York City. Since our personal experience with this type of service occurred here, we wanted to review the data to look for trends such as popular times, male versus female usership, local versus visitor usership and most common locations. We hope to be able to apply this analysis to what would be popular and work well in Des Moines for a similar rental service. 
## Results

  - **User Type Comparison** - Over 75% of the users are subscribers, meaning they are primarily getting business from residents of the city, or long term visitors. Customers (non-subscribers) would consist   of rare users and tourists, which is less than 25% of the rides.

  - **Top Start Locations** - Most popular starting locations can be seen by the largest, darkest green markers. The top places are near Grand Central, Lincoln Tunnel/Hudson Yards, Nelson Rockefeller Park, and Union Square. This fits with most users being subscribers; if the percentage of tourist users was higher, we would expect more around Central Park and Broadway. Note: There are additional small use stops in the Bronx to the north, Brooklyn to the south and Long Island to the east, but Manhattan has been focused due to highest frequency.

  - **Top Ending Locations** - Most popular ending locations can be seen by the largest, darkest green markers. The top places for ending mirror the top places for starting; this likely means that many people ride back and forth between the same start & end points (i.e. start the day leaving from Grand Central and ending at Union Square, and then end the day by riding from Union Square back to Grand Central) Note: There are additional small use stops in the Bronx to the north, Brooklyn to the south and Long Island to the east, but Manhattan has been focused due to highest frequency.

  - **Checkout Time for Users** - This graph reveals that the vast majority of trips are approximately 40 minutes or less,  and almost zero trips going beyond that length (statistically insignificant). This fits with our supposition that the majority of the bikes are used for commuting rather than sight seeing.

  - **Checkout Time by Gender** - The genders all match approximately the same pattern as the overall times, and considering there are far more male than female users. Unknown users may be more likely to be the "customers" rather than subscribers and therefore may have less complete profiles; those would be users we would expect to be doing less "commuting", so it makes sense their peak is significantly lower.

  - **Trips by Weekday for each Hour** - Weekday trips are clusered heavily around 7 am-9 am and 5 pm-7pm, further supporting our conclusion that a majority of rides are for commuting. Weekend times are more spread out throughout the day, which also fits our conclusion. For potential needed maintenance, this supports that anything between 1 am and 5 am on a weekday would be a good window.

  - **Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)** - Male & female riders have approximately the same heat map of commute time peaks, with males being more defined than females. Unknown has little recognizable pattern, except slightly higher use on the weekend, which again fits with the idea that those are more likely to be our 'tourist' users.

  - **User Trips by Gender by Weekday** - This chart can be used to further verify our conclusion that the "unknown" users are almost entirely "customers" and not "subscribers", and more likely to be the "tourist" users. By far the highest use group is our male subscrubers, with a particular peak on Thursdays.

## Summary & Recommendation
Based on our review of the data for New York City, we feel that this would not be nearly as lucrative as New York City, but may be doable with a much smaller volume. The following factors that help New York City would work against us in Des Moines:
-	New York City is very densely packed. This means that at any given location in Manhattan, just about anything is within a reasonable biking distance. The same is not true of cities in the Midwest (except perhaps parts of Chicago). 
-	It appears that a large volume of users are likely commuters. Car ownerships is much higher in Des Moines than in New York City, and with the city being much more spread out, people are going to be less likely to want to bike to work. 
-	Space is at an ultra-premium in NYC, meaning it may make more sense for someone to rent rather than own a bike, as they may not have space within their apartment. The same would not apply to the Midwest (or most other cities in the USA)
Before making a decision, further analysis would need to be done on the population of Des Moines, and of tourists to Des Moines, to gauge interest in this bike service. Without the density of businesses, close proximity to everything and a very low amount of tourism, Des Moines may not be the best city to support this sort of business.
